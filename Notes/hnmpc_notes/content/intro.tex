This chapter presents a novel zone \textcolor{red}{AF: is this 'zone' a term used in the literature or is a novel term?} nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for mixed-inititiative control. A zone NMPC relies on a dynamic cost function that updates its state and control penalty parameters in real-time according to predicted trajectories. The criteria for adapting the parameters are based on zone-excursion functions that determine \textcolor{blue}{how the control authority between the human and the robot must be mixed at each sampling instant}. 

The proposed mixed-initiative control algorithm is evaluated considering a semi-autonomous task, in which a quadrotor must be steered by a human operator through a pre-established navigation plan. Three different levels of piloting skill in humans are regarded, ranging from inexperienced to highly experienced. The results indicate that the approach operates efficiently and safely, even in scenarios of weak piloting skills, reducing the risks of crashes.
