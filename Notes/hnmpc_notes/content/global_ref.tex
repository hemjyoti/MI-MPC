We assume that the time-varying reference in position $p^d$ to be tracked is composed of a simple cartesian helical trajectory, generated using MATLAB. A radius of $r = 0.3$ m is imposed, initial height of $h_0 = 0.35$ m, height increments of $\Delta h = 0.005$ m at each time step, total duration  of $t_f = 6$ s, and $N = 400$ time steps. Moreover, we regulate for $\gamma^d \vcentcolon = (0,0,0)^T$ and $\Omega^d  \vcentcolon = 0.06546\cdot\mathbf{1_4}$, while $v_b^d  \vcentcolon = (0,0,0)^T$ and $\omega^d  \vcentcolon = (0,0,0)^T$.
