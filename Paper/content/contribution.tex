The main contributions of this work are twofold:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Novel mixed-initiative control algorithm for human-quadrotor systems based on real-time NMPC with safety guarantees.
	\item A numerical simulation that shows the computational efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
\end{itemize}

This paper is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:problem_statement} states the problem we want to solve. Section \ref{sec:algo_details} provides the details of the proposed algorithm. The numerical simulations are described, and their results are discussed in Section \ref{sec:numerical_results}. Finally, the conclusion is made in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
