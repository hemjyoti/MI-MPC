Operations such as $x \leq y$ is understood to be element-wise, whereas $\max(x)$ is vector-wise. Vectors are column vectors and we use the notation $(x; y; z)$ to denote concatenation. It is denoted by $\mathbf{I_n}$ the set of $n \times n$ identity matrices. An all-ones vector of dimension $n$ is denoted by $\mathbf{1_n}$, whereas $\mathbf{0_n}$ denotes a $n$-vector of zeros. When dealing with norms of vectors $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we denote by $\|x\|$ the Euclidean norm. The set of positive real-valued vectors of dimension $n$ is denoted by $\mathbb{R}^n_{>0}$.
