The QP subproblems arising in the SQP algorithm in \texttt{acados} are addressed using the high-performance \texttt{HPIPM} \cite{frison2020} solver, which implements a primal-dual interior-point method. It is built on top of the linear algebra package \texttt{BLASFEO} \cite{frison2018}, finely tuned for multiple CPU architectures. This Riccati-based solver implements an efficient method for the solution of linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems, a special instance of equality constrained QP. Furthermore, \texttt{BLASFEO} is hardware-optimized for the moderately sized matrices present in our mixed-initiative NMPC. We use its \texttt{X64\_INTEL\_HASWELL} implementation, which exploits a set of vectorized instructions for the target CPU. Solution times are further reduced by reformulating the QPs resulting from our NMPC using the efficient partial condensing algorithm implemented in \texttt{HPIPM}. In particular, the algorithm finds the optimal level of sparsity for the solver, trading off horizon length for input vector size.
