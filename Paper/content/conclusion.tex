In this paper, we have presented a new mixed-initiative NMPC controller for enforcing safety in human-quadrotor interactions. We adopt a predict-then-blend framework to mix human inputs and motion generator commands during operation. Through the quadrotor's predicted positions, we assess whether safety rules are met to perform then the blending, a mechanism designed to continuously measure the violation of the rules. The presented controller uses an efficient RTI-based scheme that iteratively refines the combined commands to fulfill all intrinsic constraints within the available computation time. In simulation, we evaluate our controller's performance against an autonomous algorithm that emulates the behavior of pilots with different competence levels. The results show that the control scheme allows safety enforcement with specific benefits for useful assistance to pilots, especially novices, and low computational effort. Thanks to high-performance software implementations, we can speed-up our controller's solution times, demonstrating efficient computational performance. Future work will focus on evaluating the pilot's cognitive load through real-world experiments.
